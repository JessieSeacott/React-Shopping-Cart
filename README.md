# React-Shopping-Cart

Project Description:
This was an assignment about using an API to get in stock informantion. I utilized Strapi and Postman to complete this project.

How to Run: Download these files and run on an http-server

Roadmap for improvements:
I would like to add more function the UI, such as a delete button to make it clearer how to remove items from the cart.
